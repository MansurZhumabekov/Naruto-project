          <li><p><span class="time">Chunin Exams arc -</span> Quite a few major characters get introduced in this arc. There are some fun battles here.

          <li><p><span class="time">Sasuke Recovery Mission -</span> After a fight with Naruto, Sasuke leaves Konoha. He leaves because he wants to be strong enough to fight Itachi.
